Replacement for LS in Rust

The goal is to replace LS using Rust to learn how to do some things in Rust.

1. Color Customization
  a) Yellow for Directories
  b) Green for Files
  
  
Will expand with extra features later on for accessibility such as:
1. Copying Files/Folders
2. Searching Files/Folders
3. Creating new files
